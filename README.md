# decatomb

decatomb generates high-quality annotated contigs from viral-like particle (VLP) preperations. It currently only supports processing of Illumina data (MiSeq, NextSeq, NovaSeq should all be fine). 

decatomb performs a subset of what [hecatomb](https://github.com/shandley/hecatomb) does. While hecatomb analyzes each individual read, decatomb focuses just on the production and analysis of contigs.
